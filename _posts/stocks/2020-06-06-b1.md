<p style="text-indent:30px;">This is a research paper on corporate finance which I am working on with another economist. </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;">Our point is that the change of the structure of the loan, in particular an increase of the credit loan, should have positive impact on the firm's operations and profits. The supply of the credit loan is governed by commercial banks in China. If central bank keeps the monetary policy unchanged, a short-run increase of the credit supply would mean the banks' giving in some of their profits. However, in the long run, if the firms' capital structure could be optimized, the banks enjoy may celebrate for lower loan defaults. </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;">In this picture, "CL" represents the ratio of credit loans, "GL" the guaranteed loans, "ML" the mortgage loans, and "PL" the pledged loans. The values of these four categories sum to 1. On the X-axis, we have all the industries. On the Y-axis, we have a stacked bar for each industry.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;"> We have an unbalanced longitudinal dataset from 2010 to 2019 with a semi-annual frequency. The number of observations is 36240, obtained from CSMAR (not free). This graph is produced by first averaging the ratios of each time point for a given firm, and then averaging over the industry.</p>

One problem with the above result is that a lot of varieties are removed by only considering the mean. Indeed, if we look into the distribution of the credit ratio in each industry group, not only does the q1 and q3 varies substantially, the difference between the box-plot-min and box-plot-max (excluding the outliers) are almost always 1 for each industry. The graph is ordered by the median of credit ratios of firms in each industry.

To confirm the results, we consider also the leading enterprises in each industry. The leading enterprises are defined as by considering the top 10 Assets levels in terms of Yuan in each industry. There are many interesting observations. To name a few, the leading enterprises have higher credit ratios compared to other firms in the industry, and the differences between industries are more conspicuous for Iron and Steel, Communications, Leisure/Service, and Architecture Industries.
<span>By the way, the package data.table seem to be not capable for finding the top 10 quantiles of a varible given a group. If we just need to find top N observations, it is easy: </span>
```R
  df <- setorder(df, industry, -CreditRatio)[, head(.SD,N), by=.(Industry), .SDcols = c('Industry')]
  ## or the following if we want to exclude carrying the whole data set for calculation with .SD.
  df <- setorder(df, industry, -CreditRatio)[, indx:= seq_len(.N), by=.(Industry)][indx <= N]
```
<span>If we want to find the top 10 quantiles, I created an auxilliary variable.</span>

```R
  df1 <- df %>% data.table(.) %>% .[,.(quantile(CreditRatio, 0.9)), by=.(Industry)];
  df1 <- cbind(df, .$V2) %>% .[CreditRatio>V2, .(mean(CreditRatio)), by=.(Industry)];

```
