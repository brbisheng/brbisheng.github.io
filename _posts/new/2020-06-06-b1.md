<p style="text-indent:30px;">This is a research paper on corporate finance which I am working on with another economist. </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;">Our point is that the change of the structure of the loan, in particular an increase of the credit loan, should have positive impact on the firm's operations and profits. The supply of the credit loan is governed by commercial banks in China. If central bank keeps the monetary policy unchanged, a short-run increase of the credit supply would mean the banks' giving in some of their profits. However, in the long run, if the firms' capital structure could be optimized, the banks enjoy may celebrate for lower loan defaults. </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;">In this picture, "CL" represents the ratio of credit loans, "GL" the guaranteed loans, "ML" the mortgage loans, and "PL" the pledged loans. The values of these four categories sum to 1. On the X-axis, we have all the industries. On the Y-axis, we have a stacked bar for each industry.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px;"> We have an unbalanced longitudinal dataset from 2010 to 2019 with a semi-annual frequency. The number of observations is 36240, obtained from CSMAR (not free). This graph is produced by first averaging the ratios of each time point for a given firm, and then averaging over the industry.</p>
