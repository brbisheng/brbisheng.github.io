I love summarizing methods which can be generalized.

Isn't it exciting that we discover the associations or analogies between seemingly unrelated things?

For example, the concept `group` in Algebra is closely related to the concept of `class` in Computer Science.

I am currently researching into Bayesian Statistics and TOEFL.
