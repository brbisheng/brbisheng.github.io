Is there a universal truth? What we discover are different patterns, or 'conditions --> results'.

Now, are there universal ways of dealing with things? 

I love summarizing methods which can be generalized.

Isn't it exciting that we discover the associations or analogies between seemingly unrelated things?

For example, the concept `group` in Algebra is closely related to the concept of `class` in Computer Science.

I am currently researching into Bayesian Statistics and TOEFL.

It is hard time, because it is not easy to find a job or even get an interview. But as long as I learn some new every day, I believe a change will take place.
