There is a great example on Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference from Stroustrup.

```C++
void somefunc(int a, int& r, const int& cr) {

  ++a;         // a + 1
  ++r;         // increase the object referred to by r by 1
  int x = cr;  // read the object referred to by cr, assign it to x

}

int main() {

  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  int z = 0;
  somefunc(x,y,z); // result: x==0; y==1; z==0
  somefunc(1,2,3); // error: reference argument r needs a variable to refer to
  somefunc(1,y,3); // OK: since cr is const we can pass a literal

}
```

So, if you want to change the value of an object passed by reference, you have to pass an object. 
Technically, the integer literal 2 is just a value (an rvalue), rather than an object holding a value. What you need for g()’s argument r is an lvalue, that is, something that could appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.

Note that a const reference doesn’t need an lvalue. It can perform conversions exactly as initialization or pass-by-value.

Basically, what happens in that last call, g(1,y,3), is that the compiler sets aside an int for g()’s argument cr to refer to:

g(1,y,3); // means: int__compiler_generated = 3; g(1,y,__compiler_generated)
