There is a great example on Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference from Stroustrup.

```C++
{% highlight C++ %}

void somefunc(int a, int& b, const int& c) {

  ++a;           // change the object a by 1 locally, however, the value of the global variable will not be changed!
  std::cout<< a;
  ++b;           // increase by 1 the object referred to by b 
  int d = c;     // read the object referred to by c, assign its value to d

}

int main() {

  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  int z = 0;
  somefunc(x,y,z); // result: x==0; y==1; z==0;
                   // as we expected, the value of the object x is not increased.
  somefunc(1,2,3); // error: reference argument r needs a variable to refer to
  somefunc(1,y,3); // OK: since cr is const we can pass a literal

}

{% endhighlight %}
```

1. The first line `somefunc(x,y,z)` works, because `x,y,z` are all objects holding a value.

2. If you want to change the value of an object passed by reference, you have to pass an object. 

The second line does not work, because **the integer 2 is just a value (an rvalue), rather than an object holding a value.** 

What we need for somefunc(.,.,.)’s argument b must be an **lvalue**, that is, **something that could appear on the left-hand side of an assignment.**

Note that a const reference doesn’t need an lvalue. It can perform conversions exactly as initialization or pass-by-value.

Basically, what happens in that last call, g(1,y,3), is that the compiler sets aside an int for g()’s argument cr to refer to:
